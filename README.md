This repository contains projects related to Udacity's [Deep Learning Nanodegree program](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-nanodegree--nd101). It consists of the projects completed as a part of the Nanodegree Program.

* [Predicting Bike-Sharing Patterns](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Predicting-Bike-Sharing-Patterns): Implement a neural network in NumPy to predict bike rentals.

* [Dog Breed Classifier](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Dog-Breed-Classifier): Build a convolutional neural network with PyTorch to classify any image (even an image of a face) as a specific dog breed.

* [TV Script Generation](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Generate-TV-Scripts): Train a recurrent neural network to generate scripts in the style of dialogue from Seinfeld.

* [Face Generation](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Face-Generation): Use a DCGAN on the CelebA dataset to generate images of new and realistic human faces.

* [Sentiment Analysis on AWS SageMaker](https://github.com/shrikantnaidu/Sentiment-Analysis-on-AWS-SageMaker): Deploy a Sentiment Analysis Model using AWS SageMaker.
